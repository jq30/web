		<p>Initially developed as a clone of the popular arcade game <a href="https://www.ddrgame.com/">Dance Dance Revolution</a>, StepMania has since been developed into an open-source that is used by other games as its game engine.</p>
		<p class="bordered">A modernized version of this game can be found <a href="https://www.stepmania.com/">here</a></p>
		<p>Although this game is, frankly, really old and more popular alternatives such as osu!mania and Etterna are being developed, this game still has somewhat of a fanbase, including a development team that ensures the game itself stays up-to-date with its competitors. What also helps is the fact that Etterna reads StepMania files, instead of its own file format. This pretty much merges the communities together, ensuring that one will not dry up before the other.</p>
		<p>Something to note is that although both StepMania and Etterna offers alternative gamemodes such as 5k and 7k (5 and 7 key gameplay), there are barely any files available for them, as the predominant gamemode is 4k.</p>
