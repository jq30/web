		<p><a href="https://etternaonline.com/">Etterna</a> is very similar to StepMania, being programmed as an alternative to it. Etterna features more customization than StepMania, and not only is it able to import files from StepMania, it can also import files from osu! as well.</p>
		<p>Etterna offers more customization than its predecessor, allowing users to import skins created by others, much like how osu!'s skin system works. This allows users to change the default arrows to circles or bars.</p>
		<p>Much like osu!'s leaderboard system, Etterna has its own online rankings, maintained on <a href="https://etternaonline.com/leaderboard">their website</a></p>
		<p class="bordered">Etterna can be downloaded for Windows and Mac <a href="https://github.com/etternagame/etterna/releases/">here</a>. Its source code is also publicly available.</p>
